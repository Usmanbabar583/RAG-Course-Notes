What is RAG?


RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is an AI technique that combines the power of a large language model (LLM) with an external knowledge base to 
produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. It works by first retrieving relevant information from a data source before the LLM 
generates a response based on that retrieved context, allowing the AI to access up-to-date and specific information outside of its original training data.

What LLMS Does not Do?


1--> Lacks personal information



2--> Does not access to the real world Data



3--> Does not know Context



Advantages of RAG

Injects missing information

Keeps up to date information
