**What are the vectors?**


Vectors are lists of numbers that represent some meaning. In AI and machine learning, we use them to represent words, sentences not by what they look like, but by what they mean.
The word “king” might become a vector like [0.21, 0.89, 0.13dlnlfmk.]

The word “queen” might become [0.19, 0.91, 0.dsldk
They look like random numbers, but they capture relationships and meaning — e.g.
👉 king - man + woman ≈ queen
